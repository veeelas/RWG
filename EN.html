        <p>RWG's office is located in the "Shchaslyve" district of Rivne, and this is not just a coincidence. The history of this place of choice has your roots and is connected with specific characteristics and ideas that help the company grow.</p>
            <p>This story began 4 years ago when RWG's founder, John Smith, moved to Rivne. He was struck by the community spirit and the happy people who lived in the area. People here always went out and talked to each other, and this created a special atmosphere of happiness and friendship.</p>
